# Wow, you are on fire! ;)

Welcome to the part three, of this demo.
The next instructions make the assumption that you have already finished the
previous steps.

* 1. Deploy new Database rules

```sh
firebase deploy --only database
```

* 2. Test the application locally

```sh
npm run dev
```

Write some message (you can open another browser also, to see them both updating)

* 3. Deploy this new version to to Firebase Hosting

```sh
npm run deploy
```
